# Homework 5 - USA Airport Flight Analysis  

**Project Description**  
This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset on airports and flights in the United States. Air travel forms a dense and dynamic network connecting cities. In this assignment, various data analysis and optimization techniques were applied to identify the busiest airports, analyze flight routes, examine the structure of the network, detect communities, and evaluate the impact of disruptions.

## Project Overview  

This assignment involves analyzing the USA Airport Dataset. The tasks include:  
- Analyzing the basic features of the flight network.  
- Identifying the busiest routes and underutilized connections.  
- Calculating centrality measures for airports.  
- Detecting communities within the network.  
- Creating interactive visualizations on a map.  
- Analyzing connected components using the MapReduce paradigm.

## Tasks and Outputs  

### Task 1: Flight Network Analysis  
- Analyzed the size, density, and degree distribution of the network.  
- Identified the busiest airports and visualized the findings.  
- Analyzed top routes and passenger traffic efficiency.  

### Task 2: Nodes' Contribution  
- Calculated betweenness, closeness, and degree centrality.  
- Applied PageRank and identified central airports.  

### Task 3: Finding Best Routes  
- Designed and implemented an algorithm to determine the best flight routes.  

### Task 4: Airline Network Partitioning  
- Divided the network into two disconnected subgraphs and visualized them.  

### Task 5: Community Detection  
- Detected communities among cities and visualized them.  

### Bonus: Connected Components with MapReduce  
- Identified connected components in large-scale graphs using PySpark.
